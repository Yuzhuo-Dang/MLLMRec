The original dataset is the publicly available [Baby/Sports/Clothing](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html) datasets from Amazon.

We provide the processed Baby dataset the in the "`data/baby`" folder for directly running model training to test MLLMRec. The other two processed datasets have been uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lKuPANPB6X2iyHwe07UixU0NdoSzinBE?usp=drive_link).
